# Protein Sequence Classification with Transformer Model

## Introduction

This is a proof-of-concept project demonstrating the use of PyTorch and Transformer architecture for protein function classification. The project simulates the basic pipeline of deep learning applications in bioinformatics.

## Project Status

- **Current Status**: Model training in progress...
- **Dataset**: 90,373 protein sequences from UniProt
- **Task**: Binary classification (Enzyme vs Non-Enzyme)
- **Class Distribution**: Non-Enzyme: 76,370, Enzyme: 14,003
- **Model**: Transformer-based classifier (804,546 parameters)

## Preliminary Results

*Training in progress... Results will be updated upon completion.*

## Installation

```bash
